A larger  f  makes the lemniscate wider, while a smaller  f  makes it narrower.  d shifts the graph along the x-axis. Increasing  d  moves the curve to the right, and decreasing it moves the curve to the left. By experimenting with different values of f and  d, you can see how the curve’s shape and position change. For example, smaller  f  values result in a more compact curve, while larger values make the lemniscate expand. Additionally, changing  d  helps reposition the curve to avoid overlap between multiple graphs. Adjusting  f  affects the width of the lemniscate, while d  controls its horizontal position. These adjustments allow for greater flexibility and clarity when plotting multiple curves.\n",

The larger  f results in a more pronounced curve.  d = 1500  shifts the curve to the right, preventing overlap with other curves or the y-axis. This adjustment helps in creating a clearer, more readable graph, especially when multiple lemniscates are plotted. The combination of adjusting  f  and  d  allows for better visualization, making the graph well-spaced and easy to interpret.\n",

        "In this example, let's choose f = 3 and d = 500. With  f = 3 , the foci are placed closer together, resulting in a narrower lemniscate curve. This is useful when you want to focus on a smaller, more compact curve and emphasize the central part of the graph. The value  d = 500  shifts the curve to the right along the x-axis, providing ample space to avoid overlap with the y-axis or other elements in the plot. This choice of  f  and  d  is beneficial for creating a graph that highlights the internal structure of the lemniscate, especially in situations where clarity and spacing between curves are important for better visualization and comparison.\n"

        "A torus is defined by two parameters: the major radius (R), which controls the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius (r), which controls the thickness of the tube. Increasing R makes the torus larger and moves it farther from the origin, while increasing r makes the tube thicker, reducing the hole in the center. Larger values of R result in a bigger overall shape, while larger r creates a fuller, thicker ring. Adjusting both parameters together can create a variety of torus shapes, from thin rings to large, thick tubes.\n",
